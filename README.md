# Music-Player-App
## General Info
This project is a simple music player with songs form a playlist I created.
## Technologies Used 
Prjoect is is created with:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
## Challenges 
* CSS Positioning: I had to do trial and error with positioning as I added more. I am still working towards improving.
* JavaScript: Since this is my first project doing JS alone, most parts were very confusing. As I started to gain more understanding and researched, I managed to figure it out.
## Success
Learning more about JavaScript and CSS was a huge success for me. I enjoyed the step by step process that I took and solving problems.
Patience was also very important to me. Throughout the confusing parts of this project, I remained patient and took mental breaks as needed.
## Future of the project
Features I plan to add:
* Search
* Curated Playlists
* Offline Mode
* Equalizer
* Shuffle and repeat buttons
